### Automated testing
Ensures that the application keeps working no matter how much new functions were added or how many developers are in the team.

1. Unit Test
  Unit tests cover blocks of code to ensure they run without problems. Unit tests should be isolated and independent of each other. For a given input, unit test checks the result. It can help you make sure that individual parts of your applications work as expected.
2. Integration tests
  Integration tests cover cross-module processes, where individual modules are combined and tested while working together.

### TDD (Test Driven Development)
  Creates tests before creating functionalities.
  The tests guides how your functions should work.
